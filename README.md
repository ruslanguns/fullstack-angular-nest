# FullStack with NestJS AND Angular 7+
Author: Ruslán González <ruslanguns@gmail.com>

## Introduction
This is a FullStack ready using two of the greatest frameworks in Javascript industry as [Angular](http://angular.io) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/).

## Instalation
Basically what you have to do is very simple, just cd to each folder, client or server and then install dependencies.

### Client
```bash
$ cd client
$ npm i
```

### Server
```bash
$ cd server
$ npm i
```

## Development
For devepment it's also quite simple, you only have to understand that it's pure Angular and Nest on both sides. `ng serve` for Angular and `npm run start:dev` for NestJS.

## Production
For building it's also the same way as in development, runing build commands for each purpose. The way I put this files it's only to have a nice way to have everything in one place, and manage Git Repository properly for your Fullstack project.

## TO-DOs
* [ ] Dockerfile implementation
* [ ] Docker Compose implementation
